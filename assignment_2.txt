<p>1.</p><p>Primary key: is a unique identifier of the relation that make sure that all row in the table is unique from each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Foreign key: identifier whose value corresponds to the value of a primary key in the other table. The foreign is the key that refers back primary key (parent relation)</p><p>The foreign key is used as a link that relates the data from its table to the data of the table that has the primary key. When there is a one-to-many relationship, a foreign key is needed to refer back to the one side of the relationship, which contains the primary key.&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;</p><p>Domain constraint: it is all allowable values for an attribute&nbsp;</p><p>Entity integrity constraint: it is when the primary key cannot have no input (or can not be NULL). The foreign key is a field within the primary key, and it can be NULL only when there is an optional one on the primary key side.&nbsp;</p><p>Referential integrity constraints: All the foreign key values must match the value of the primary in the relation. &nbsp;Are represented by arrows from the foreign key side (dependent relation side) to the primary key side (parent relation side).&nbsp;</p><p>If these constraints are violated, the model will reflect an incorrect database structure, this in return will make the database not be able to run and return accurate data with the input value from the user.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
